# 🩸 LifeShare - Blood Donation Platform

## 📌 Project Purpose
LifeShare is a comprehensive and modern web application designed to bridge the gap between voluntary blood donors and people in critical need. It streamlines the process of creating blood donation requests, searching for available donors based on specific locations, and managing donation activities through role-based dashboards. Our mission is to make finding a blood donor as quick and effortless as possible to save lives.
